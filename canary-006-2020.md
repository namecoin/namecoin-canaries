# Namecoin Canary #6

## Statements

The Namecoin developers who have digitally signed this file [1] state the following:

1. The date of issue of this canary is October 2, 2020.
2. No warrants, subpoenas, national security letters, or government-issued gag orders have ever been served to us with regard to Namecoin (e.g. to hand out the private signing keys or to introduce backdoors), except as described in the "List of incidents" below, and in the "List of incidents" from previous-numbered canaries.
3. We plan to publish the next of these canary statements in the first two weeks of January 2021. Special note should be taken if no new canary is published by that time or if the list of statements changes without plausible explanation.

## Special announcements

We apologize for the delay in renewing the canary.  There is no substantive reason for the delay (i.e. the "Statements" section never stopped being accurate).  The delay was for a quite boring reason: the VM's responsible for scheduling and creating canaries were decommissioned during a hardware migration, and the responsible developer neglected to recreate them on the new hardware.

## List of incidents

None.

## Disclaimers and notes

This canary scheme is not infallible. Although signing the declaration makes it very difficult for a third party to produce arbitrary declarations, it does not prevent them from using force or other means, like blackmail or compromising the signers' laptops, to coerce us to produce false declarations.

The news feeds quoted below (Proof of freshness) serves to demonstrate that this canary could not have been created prior to the date stated.  It shows that a series of canaries was not created in advance.

This declaration is merely a best effort and is provided without any guarantee or warranty. It is not legally binding in any way to anybody. None of the signers should be ever held legally responsible for any of the statements made here.
